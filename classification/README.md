# Prediction of hotel reservations cancellation

This project is dedicated to the prediction of the reservation that could be cancelled.
Our database contains 36,275 individuals, each referenced by a unique identifier. We observe 18 features associated with them, 14 of which are numeric: 1 of type Float and 13 of type Integer, where some can be seen as Booleans like repeated_guest or even required_car_parking_space, varying between 0 and 1. The remaining 4 are strings.
